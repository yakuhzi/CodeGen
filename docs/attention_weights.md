# Attention Weight Analysis

## Jupyter Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook was created to visualize the attention weights of the TransCoder-ST model. It is available [here](../codegen_sources/scripts/analysis/attention_weights.ipynb).

Make sure you used the created conda environment `c2c-translation`. To add it as a kernel for your notebook, run the following commands:

```sh
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=c2c-translation
```
